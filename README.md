# XITE Frontend Coding Exercise

Welcome to the XITE Frontend Coding Exercise repository. This is my solution for the problem you assigned to me, feel free to ask me any question! :)
I drove toward this solution thanks to some libraries, such as React Bootstrap, and everything is coded in TypeScript.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Folders explanation

Everything is based just on one page: `home.tsx`, in which I gathered all the components I used for this purpose.
Each component is enclosed into the `components` folder, whereas the CSS modules are gathered into the `styles` folder.
Nothing more, nothing less! :)
